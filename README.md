BACTER
======

BACTER is a [BEAST 2](http://beast2.org) package which facilitates
inference of a (restricted kind of) ancestral recombination graph
(ARG) and related parameters from a sequence alignment.  It is based on the model
described in
[Didelot et al.'s 2010 Genetics paper](http://www.genetics.org/content/186/4/1435).

This archive contains the source code of the package and is therefore of primary
interest to programmers.  For installation and usage instructions, please visit
the project home page hosted at http://tgvaughan.github.io/bacter.
